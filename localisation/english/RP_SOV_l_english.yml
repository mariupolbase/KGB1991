 sov.1.t: "The Founding of the National-Bolshevik Party
 sov.1.d: "The National Bolshevik Party (NBP) was founded today in Moscow as a radical political organization, becoming the first nationalist party after a long time in its absence. It combines elements of communism and nationalism. The party was founded by Russian political activist Eduard Limonov and Alexander Dugin, together with Yegor Letov. The NBP became known for its extreme views and commitment to a national-Bolshevik ideology, which combines elements of nationalism, socialism and anti-capitalism. It has also become known for its aggressive stance toward other political parties and our government."
 sov.1.a: "This must end!"
 sov.1.b: "Sounds interesting..."
 sov.2.t: "Defeat in Georgia"
 sov.2.d: "After long and bloody, mountain raids and acts of sabotage, Georgian separatists completely defeated our troops in Georgia and almost reached the administrative borders of the Georgian SSR.\n A new wave of discontent with separatist sentiments swept through the country. Many of our citizens were very upset by this defeat and began to increasingly doubt the competence of the Soviet state. It also sent a signal to separatist movements throughout the union that gaining independence by armed insurrection was not an impossible task."
 sov.2.a: "What a shame..."
