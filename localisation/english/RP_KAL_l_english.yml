  KAL_national_congress: "National Congress of Kalmykia"
  KAL_national_congress_desc: "§gThe National Congress of Kalmykia is the highest authority in Kalmykia. There are many factions in the Congress, from liberals to nationalists, but despite the fragmentation, the Congress is united together with the entire Kalmyk people in the face of a common enemy, Soviet Russia.\nIn June 27, 1991, after the declaration of Kalmyk independence, the formation of the National Congress began. In the beginning it consisted of ideological, charged independence fighters who were ready to give their lives for the independence of their homeland. But after a failed attempt to free the entire territory of the republic from the Russian occupation and a retreat to Elista, followed by a cease-fire, they were gradually replaced by more overbearing, corrupt and pragmatic politicians.\nIn spite of some political instability and political reshuffling, the Congress remains united before a common enemy and a common goal of creating a free and independent Kalmykia§!"
